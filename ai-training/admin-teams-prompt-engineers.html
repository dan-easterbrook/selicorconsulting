    <h1>Why Admin Teams Are the New Prompt Engineers</h1>
    <p>Practical ways to unlock AI productivity in everyday work, with safety and clear outcomes.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <p><strong>Many organisations are exploring how AI can improve performance.</strong> The fastest gains are not in advanced modelling or complex data science, they are in the routine tasks that keep a business moving every day.</p>

    <p>Admin and operations teams already sit at the heart of this work. They organise information, prepare materials, support communication and track actions. This is where AI gives a clear and immediate lift.</p>

    <p>AI can turn inbox threads into a clean summary, suggest next actions, shape a first draft of a document or prepare a note for the CRM. The human still makes the decision, the time spent reaching that point is simply reduced.</p>

    <h2>The simple pattern that works</h2>
    <p>Set the task, share the information, provide a tone, ask for a clear structure, review before sending. With very little training, this becomes second nature.</p>

    <h2>Safety is a habit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use clear rules for what can be shared.</li>
      <li>Keep human review in place.</li>
      <li>Save the prompts that work well so the team can reuse them.</li>
      <li>Measure time saved and adoption from the first week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to start</h2>
    <p>Pick one team. Identify five tasks they do every single week. Provide three example prompts for each task. Look at the results at the end of the week. Make a small change and repeat. Confidence grows quickly when people see the value in their own work.</p>

    <h2>The outcome</h2>
    <p>People spend less time on repetitive work, communication becomes clearer, managers make decisions faster, customers receive quicker responses. The team feels more in control, not less.</p>

    <h2>How I support this</h2>
    <p>I help set the guardrails, explain the basics and create simple playbooks that fit your tools, your tone and your goals. We focus on real outcomes, not hype.</p>

    <p>If you would like to explore this with your team, I would be happy to help.</p>
