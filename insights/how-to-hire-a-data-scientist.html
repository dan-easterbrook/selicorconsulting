    <h2>How to hire a data scientist</h2>
    <p><strong>Start with the problem, not the person.</strong></p>

    <p>
      "Data scientist" is one of the most overloaded titles in modern business.
      In some organisations it means experimentation and modelling.
      In others it means dashboards with Python.
      In others it means deploying production services.
      When a title can mean anything, hiring becomes guesswork.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest way to hire well is to define the problem you want to solve, then shape the role around outcomes.
      If you get the outcome wrong, even great candidates will struggle.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Define the outcome in plain language</h3>
    <p>Write one sentence that a non technical leader would understand. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce customer churn by improving retention targeting.</li>
      <li>Improve underwriting decisions using better risk signals.</li>
      <li>Forecast demand so operations can plan capacity with confidence.</li>
      <li>Automate a manual decision process safely and measurably.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you cannot write the sentence, you are not ready to hire.
      You are still discovering the problem.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Decide what kind of data scientist you actually need</h3>
    <p>
      Most teams hire the wrong profile because they do not distinguish between three common variants.
      The right choice depends on your maturity and what is blocking progress.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Insight and experimentation</strong><br>
        Focus: analysis, hypothesis testing, prototypes, stakeholder storytelling.<br>
        Best when: you need direction and prioritisation, not production services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Applied modelling</strong><br>
        Focus: building and validating predictive models, feature work, evaluation.<br>
        Best when: you have decent data access and clear use cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Production oriented data science</strong><br>
        Focus: shipping models into products, monitoring, reliability, collaboration with engineers.<br>
        Best when: you already have engineering support and a path to deployment.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Match the hire to your maturity level</h3>
    <p>Use this quick maturity check.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early stage:</strong> you need a generalist who can explore, communicate, and get traction with imperfect data.</li>
      <li><strong>Mid stage:</strong> you need applied modelling plus enough engineering fluency to work with platform teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Mature:</strong> you need specialists who can scale models, monitoring, and production workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A common mistake is hiring a specialist into an early stage environment.
      They end up doing data cleaning and stakeholder alignment, then leaving.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Write a job spec that reflects reality</h3>
    <p>Great specs have four elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> what the role will change in the business.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> what is in and out, especially in the first 90 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> what data, tools, and support exist today.</li>
      <li><strong>Measures:</strong> how success will be evaluated and by whom.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Avoid long lists of tools.
      Good candidates assume they can learn tools.
      They care more about ownership, decision making, and whether the problem is real.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Design an interview that tests the work</h3>
    <p>A simple process that works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Context call:</strong> can they translate a business problem into a data approach.</li>
      <li><strong>Case discussion:</strong> a realistic scenario using your context, not generic puzzles.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration round:</strong> how they work with engineering, product, and stakeholders.</li>
      <li><strong>Values and risk:</strong> privacy, bias, governance, and how they handle constraints.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you are hiring for production, include engineering in the process.
      If you are hiring for insight and experimentation, include decision makers who will use the work.
    </p>

    <h3>Common mistakes that derail hiring</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hiring "a unicorn" because you cannot choose what matters most.</li>
      <li>Putting the role in the wrong reporting line, so it has no authority.</li>
      <li>Expecting one person to fix data quality, modelling, deployment, and stakeholder trust.</li>
      <li>Using generic interview questions that do not reflect the real work.</li>
      <li>Waiting for a perfect candidate instead of building a realistic plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How I help</h3>
    <p>
      Before a search, I help you pressure test role purpose, reporting line, success metrics, and hiring sequence.
      It is designed to be light touch and practical.
      You get a short summary that you can share internally, then we execute hiring aligned to that plan.
