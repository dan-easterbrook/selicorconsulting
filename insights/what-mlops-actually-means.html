    <h2>What MLOps actually means, and why most teams hire it too late</h2>

    <p><strong>MLOps exists because models do not fail in notebooks. They fail in the real world.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Many organisations can build a model.
      Fewer can deploy one reliably.
      Even fewer can monitor it, retrain it, and govern it over time.
      That gap is what MLOps is for.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hiring mistake I see most often is this.
      Teams hire data scientists first, generate prototypes, then realise they have no pathway to production.
      At that point, MLOps is hired under pressure, with unclear ownership and unrealistic expectations.
    </p>

    <h3>A practical definition</h3>
    <p>
      MLOps is the set of practices and platform capabilities that make machine learning systems deployable, observable, and controllable.
      It bridges experimentation and production.
      It is part engineering, part platform, and part governance.
    </p>

    <h3>What MLOps is not</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not just deployment</strong>. Shipping a model once is the easy part. Running it safely over time is the work.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a tool purchase</strong>. Tooling helps, but ownership and operating model matter more.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a data scientist side project</strong>. It needs dedicated engineering attention and standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a single hire</strong> if the organisation is scaling multiple models across products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why models fail after deployment</h3>
    <p>
      Production failure rarely looks like a crash.
      It looks like slow degradation.
      A model that quietly stops performing, or a pipeline that drifts, or behaviour that changes as the world changes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Training and serving data do not match</li>
      <li>Data quality shifts, and no one notices</li>
      <li>Concept drift changes underlying patterns</li>
      <li>Latency and cost are higher than expected</li>
      <li>Governance requirements block release</li>
      <li>No one owns monitoring, retraining, or rollback decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Signs you need MLOps now</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You have models in production or you are planning to ship one in the next 3 to 6 months</li>
      <li>Data scientists are spending time on packaging, CI/CD, and infrastructure</li>
      <li>You cannot explain how a model is monitored, audited, or retrained</li>
      <li>Your release process involves manual steps and informal approvals</li>
      <li>Security and compliance are slowing delivery because standards are unclear</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When you should not hire MLOps yet</h3>
    <p>
      This might sound counterintuitive, but not every organisation needs MLOps immediately.
      If you are still proving a use case, do not overbuild.
      The key is having a credible path to deployment, even if it is simple.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You have no clear use case that is going to production</li>
      <li>Your data foundations are not stable enough to support reliable pipelines</li>
      <li>There is no engineering ownership for production systems</li>
      <li>No one can define what success and risk look like for the first model</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The common MLOps hire archetypes</h3>
    <p>
      MLOps titles vary. Clarifying which archetype you need avoids most mis-hires.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Platform MLOps</strong><br>
        Builds shared infrastructure, standards, and tooling for multiple teams and models.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Product embedded MLOps</strong><br>
        Works with one product team to ship, monitor, and operate a model end to end.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ML reliability and monitoring</strong><br>
        Focuses on observability, drift detection, alerts, performance metrics, and safe rollback.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to clarify before you hire</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ownership</strong>: who signs off deployments and who owns incidents.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope</strong>: one model, one product, or a shared platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Tooling reality</strong>: what exists today, what is mandated, and what can change.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance stance</strong>: privacy, security, audit, and what is non negotiable.</li>
      <li><strong>Success metrics</strong>: reliability, time to deploy, model performance stability, and incident reduction.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>If you want to go deeper</h3>
    <p>
      I also have a dedicated guide on <a href="/mlops-recruitment.html">MLOps recruitment</a>.
      If you are unsure whether you need MLOps now, we can pressure test the deployment pathway and ownership model quickly before you go to market.
