  <h2>AI operating model checklist for CDOs and CTOs</h2>

  <p><strong>Speed comes from ownership and clarity, not more tools.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Most AI programmes stall for predictable reasons.
    Use cases are unclear, ownership is split, governance is bolted on late, and deployment is treated as an afterthought.
    This checklist is a practical way to spot gaps before they become delivery problems.
  </p>

  <h3>1) Ownership</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Is there a single accountable owner for AI outcomes?</li>
    <li>Who decides what gets built and what gets paused?</li>
    <li>Who owns incidents, rollbacks, and retraining decisions?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2) Use case discipline</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can each use case be expressed as a measurable outcome?</li>
    <li>Do you have a prioritisation framework that leadership agrees on?</li>
    <li>Do you have clear “stop rules” for work that is not landing value?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3) Deployment pathway</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can you describe the path from prototype to production in one page?</li>
    <li>Is the engineering owner clear?</li>
    <li>Do you have monitoring, alerting, and auditability built into the plan?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4) Governance that enables delivery</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do teams know what is non negotiable (privacy, security, access)?</li>
    <li>Are approvals clear and timeboxed?</li>
    <li>Is governance owned, or is it a shared worry?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5) Capability design</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you know whether you need product leadership, modelling, platform, or MLOps first?</li>
    <li>Are job specs aligned to reality and authority?</li>
    <li>Do reporting lines support outcomes, not just org charts?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you want a quick sanity check, this is exactly the sort of conversation I run before a retained search.
    It is light touch, practical, and it usually saves weeks.
