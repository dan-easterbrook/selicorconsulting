    <h2>Why AI recruitment is different</h2>
    <p><strong>AI hiring fails more often upstream than it does in interview.</strong></p>

    <p>
      When organisations say they need "AI talent", what they often mean is one of three things.
      They want to ship a real product feature.
      They want to automate part of a workflow.
      Or they want to look credible to customers, leadership, or investors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those are not the same problem, and they do not require the same hire.
      This is why AI recruitment is different.
      The title is rarely the issue.
      The operating context is.
    </p>

    <h3>Most AI roles fail because the role is not real</h3>
    <p>
      A role becomes hard to hire for when it sits on top of uncertainty.
      Unclear ownership, unclear data foundations, unclear deployment path, unclear risk appetite.
      Candidates can sense this quickly.
      Strong people avoid it.
      Others take it, then struggle.
    </p>

    <p>Here are the most common signals that the role is not yet properly defined:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No one can describe what success looks like in 90 days and in 12 months.</li>
      <li>The team wants "someone who can build models" but there is no plan to deploy them.</li>
      <li>Ownership is split across teams, so decisions take weeks.</li>
      <li>Security and governance are mentioned, but no one owns the rules.</li>
      <li>The data foundation is assumed rather than proven.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI recruitment is a capability design exercise</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional data hiring often sits inside a known pattern.
      Reports, dashboards, pipelines, stakeholder management.
      AI roles can be any of those, but with additional constraints.
      Model risk, drift, evaluation, monitoring, data privacy, explainability, and real product integration.
    </p>

    <p>
      That means hiring needs to start with capability design, not job titles.
      Before you write a job spec, pressure test these questions:
    </p>

    <h3>The five questions to answer before you go to market</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What are we building?</strong> A product feature, an internal workflow improvement, or a research capability.</li>
      <li><strong>Who owns the outcome?</strong> One accountable owner, not a committee.</li>
      <li><strong>What is the deployment path?</strong> How code moves from notebook to production, and who supports it.</li>
      <li><strong>What is the risk position?</strong> How you will handle privacy, bias, security, audit, and customer impact.</li>
      <li><strong>What does success look like?</strong> Measurable outcomes, plus leading indicators that show progress early.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The three AI hire archetypes</h3>
    <p>
      One of the biggest hiring mistakes is combining three jobs into one.
      Most teams need one of these first, not all of them at once.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The applied ML builder</strong><br>
        Focus: model development and iteration, close to the data and the use case.<br>
        Needs: data access, clear evaluation, a product partner, and a path to deployment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The ML platform and MLOps engineer</strong><br>
        Focus: pipelines, packaging, monitoring, release processes, and reliability.<br>
        Needs: engineering alignment, platform ownership, and realistic scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The AI product lead</strong><br>
        Focus: choosing the right problems, translating constraints, shipping outcomes.<br>
        Needs: authority across teams, clear KPIs, and governance support.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your job spec expects one person to be all three, you will either miss good candidates or hire someone who burns out.
    </p>

    <h3>What strong candidates look for</h3>
    <p>Top AI candidates usually ask versions of the same questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What data is available, and what is its quality like?</li>
      <li>How do we evaluate and measure model performance?</li>
      <li>Who signs off deployment, and how long does it take?</li>
      <li>What is the governance stance and what is non negotiable?</li>
      <li>Who will I work with day to day, and how are decisions made?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you can answer these with confidence, your hiring process becomes easier.
      Candidates lean in.
      Interviews become real conversations.
      Compensation becomes less of a sticking point because the role feels solid.
    </p>

    <h3>A simple hiring plan that lands</h3>
    <p>
      If you want a practical approach, use this sequence:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Define the use case and success metrics. Keep it narrow.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Confirm the deployment path. Who owns engineering and platform decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide which archetype you need first. Builder, platform, or product.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Write a spec that reflects reality, not ambition.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Run an interview process that tests the work, not just the theory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How I help</h3>
    <p>
      Before I run a search, I will pressure test the capability structure with you.
      It is light touch.
      One focused conversation, then a short written summary.
      If the role is not ready, I will tell you.
      If it is ready, we go to market with a brief that strong candidates take seriously.
