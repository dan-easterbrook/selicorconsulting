  <h1>Why AI Recruitment Is Different</h1>
  <p>Practical takeaways for hiring beyond the hype.</p>
</section>


  <section>
    <p>Hiring for AI roles isn't the same as hiring for traditional data or analytics positions. The technology is evolving faster than most job specs can keep up with, and the skills that mattered 12 months ago may already be outdated.</p>

    <p>AI recruitment requires a different lens — one that balances core engineering and data science skills with an understanding of ethical use, model deployment, and business alignment. It’s not just about finding talent that can build; it’s about finding people who can scale safely and responsibly.</p>

    <p>At Selicor Consulting, I spend time understanding not just what companies want to automate, but *why*. That context drives better matches and more sustainable teams.</p>
