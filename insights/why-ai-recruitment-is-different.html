  <h2>Why AI recruitment is different</h2>
  <p><strong>Most AI hiring failures are decided before the first interview.</strong></p>

  <p>
    When organisations say they need “AI talent”, the job title is rarely the real issue.
    The issue is whether the organisation has a credible operating context for the work.
    Ownership, deployment, governance, data foundations, and success metrics.
  </p>

  <h3>The most common upstream problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No one can describe success in 90 days and 12 months</li>
    <li>There is no deployment pathway from prototype to production</li>
    <li>Ownership is split across teams, so decisions stall</li>
    <li>Security and governance exist as concerns, not as owned rules</li>
    <li>Data quality is assumed rather than measured</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>AI recruitment is capability design</h3>
  <p>
    AI hiring works when the capability shape is clear.
    That includes what is being built, who owns the outcome, how it is deployed, how risk is handled, and how success is measured.
  </p>

  <h3>Five questions to answer before you go to market</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>What are we building?</strong> A product feature, a workflow improvement, or a research capability.</li>
    <li><strong>Who owns the outcome?</strong> One accountable owner with decision rights.</li>
    <li><strong>What is the deployment path?</strong> How work moves into production and how it is supported.</li>
    <li><strong>What is the risk position?</strong> Privacy, security, audit, and customer impact.</li>
    <li><strong>What does success look like?</strong> Outcomes plus leading indicators.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Where this connects to hiring</h3>
  <p>
    If your first AI hire is going to ship and operate models, you will likely need MLOps capability.
    If your problem is prioritisation and translation, you may need an AI Product Lead.
    If your foundations are unstable, you may need data engineering first.
