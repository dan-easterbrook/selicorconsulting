    <h2>Data Engineering vs Analytics Engineering, and why it matters</h2>

    <p><strong>Most teams do not have a hiring problem. They have a definition problem.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Data Engineering and Analytics Engineering are often treated as interchangeable. They are not.
      When organisations blur the two, three things usually happen.
      Delivery slows because ownership is unclear.
      Costs rise because the wrong people are asked to do the wrong work.
      And hiring becomes painful because candidates do not recognise the role.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide is a practical way to separate the two, decide what you need, and hire in the right order.
    </p>

    <h3>Quick definitions</h3>
    <p>
      These are not the only definitions in the world, but they are useful in practice.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Engineering</strong><br>
        Building and operating the systems that move, store, and govern data reliably at scale.
        Think ingestion, pipelines, orchestration, data quality, access, security, and platform reliability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics Engineering</strong><br>
        Shaping curated data models that the business can use, with consistent definitions and trustworthy metrics.
        Think transformation layers, semantic models, reporting datasets, and metric governance close to stakeholders.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why the confusion happens</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tooling blurred the lines</strong>: modern stacks make transformation easier, so teams expect one person to do everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Job titles drift</strong>: "Data Engineer" is used for BI developers, platform engineers, and analytics engineers.</li>
      <li><strong>Urgency pushes shortcuts</strong>: teams want dashboards now, so they hire for output, not foundations.</li>
      <li><strong>Organisations underinvest in ownership</strong>: no one is accountable for definitions, so each team builds its own.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What happens when you hire the wrong one</h3>
    <p>
      Here are common misfires I see repeatedly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You hire a platform data engineer and ask them to build metrics and stakeholder reporting. They disengage, or the work becomes slow and brittle.</li>
      <li>You hire an analytics engineer and expect them to solve ingestion, reliability, and data quality at source. They cannot, and the business blames the person.</li>
      <li>You hire a senior title without scope, and the role becomes an escalation point for every data issue in the company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to decide what you need</h3>
    <p>
      Use this simple diagnostic. If you answer "yes" more often in one column, start there.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>You likely need Data Engineering first if</strong><br>
        your pipelines are unreliable, data is hard to access, quality is inconsistent, or security and governance are unclear.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You likely need Analytics Engineering first if</strong><br>
        the data exists but the business does not trust it, definitions differ across teams, and reporting changes constantly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The right hiring sequence in most organisations</h3>
    <p>
      In many environments, the best sequence is not "hire the smartest data engineer you can find".
      It is building the foundations and the model layer in a deliberate order.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stabilise data movement and access</strong> so teams can work without firefighting.</li>
      <li><strong>Define core metrics and entities</strong> so the business is not debating numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Build a scalable modelling layer</strong> so self service becomes realistic.</li>
      <li><strong>Only then scale specialisms</strong>, including platform optimisation, governance, and MLOps.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Interviewing for the right capability</h3>
    <p>
      One of the fastest ways to improve hiring outcomes is to interview for real work, not buzzwords.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>For Data Engineering</strong><br>
        Ask about reliability patterns, data quality approaches, access and security, orchestration choices, and how they work with stakeholders when trade-offs appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For Analytics Engineering</strong><br>
        Ask about modelling approach, metric consistency, testing, documentation, stakeholder influence, and how they manage change without breaking trust.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A practical rule that avoids most mistakes</h3>
    <p>
      If your brief reads like a full platform build and a full reporting layer build, it is probably two hires.
      Separate the mandate, then hire in sequence.
    </p>

    <h3>If you want to go deeper</h3>
    <p>
      I also have a dedicated guide on <a href="/data-engineering-recruitment.html">Data Engineering recruitment</a>.
      If you are unsure which capability you need first, we can pressure test the structure quickly before you go to market.
