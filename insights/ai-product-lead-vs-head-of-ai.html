    <h2>AI Product Lead vs Head of AI, choosing the right leadership role</h2>

    <p><strong>AI fails less often because of modelling. It fails more often because of ownership.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Organisations investing in AI often face the same early decision.
      Do we hire a Head of AI to lead capability?
      Or do we hire an AI Product Lead to translate use cases into measurable value?
    </p>

    <p>
      These are not interchangeable roles.
      Confusing them leads to misaligned expectations, unclear reporting lines, and slow delivery.
    </p>

    <h3>Head of AI</h3>

    <p>
      A Head of AI is typically responsible for capability strategy and long term direction.
      This role is often accountable for research direction, technical standards, team build, governance posture, and cross organisational AI maturity.
    </p>

    <h4>When this role makes sense</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You are building AI as a core organisational capability</li>
      <li>You expect multiple products or business units to use AI</li>
      <li>You need technical direction and governance leadership</li>
      <li>You are hiring or scaling an ML and MLOps team</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Risks if poorly defined</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The role becomes purely technical and disconnected from business outcomes</li>
      <li>Stakeholders expect immediate ROI without product clarity</li>
      <li>Governance is bolted on after delivery</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI Product Lead</h3>

    <p>
      An AI Product Lead sits between capability and commercial impact.
      The focus is not building AI for its own sake.
      It is defining use cases, prioritising delivery, managing risk, and ensuring measurable business outcomes.
    </p>

    <h4>When this role makes sense</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have AI capability already, but delivery is inconsistent</li>
      <li>You struggle to prioritise use cases</li>
      <li>Stakeholders are unsure how AI translates into revenue, cost reduction, or risk mitigation</li>
      <li>You need a bridge between technical teams and commercial leadership</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Risks if poorly defined</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The role becomes a coordination function without authority</li>
      <li>AI capability is constrained by unclear governance</li>
      <li>Technical teams disengage due to unclear decision rights</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The structural difference</h3>

    <p>
      A simple way to distinguish the two is this.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Head of AI</strong> owns capability and standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Product Lead</strong> owns outcomes and prioritisation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In larger organisations, you often need both.
      In smaller or earlier stage businesses, hiring the wrong one first can stall progress.
    </p>

    <h3>Questions to answer before hiring either</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Is AI central to the strategy, or a supporting capability?</li>
      <li>Who owns risk, governance, and regulatory posture?</li>
      <li>How are use cases prioritised today?</li>
      <li>Is there a defined pathway from prototype to production?</li>
      <li>What does measurable success look like in year one?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What good looks like in 12 months</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Clear ownership of AI direction</li>
      <li>Defined use case roadmap</li>
      <li>Governance integrated into delivery</li>
      <li>At least one production use case delivering measurable value</li>
      <li>A scalable hiring and capability plan aligned to strategy</li>
    </ul>
