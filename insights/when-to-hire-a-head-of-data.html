    <h2>When you should hire a Head of Data, and when you shouldn’t</h2>

    <p><strong>The title is easy. The mandate is the hard part.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Head of Data is one of the most requested roles in the market, and one of the most frequently misunderstood.
      Some organisations need a leader to build a data function from scratch.
      Others need a leader to stabilise foundations and governance.
      Others need a leader to unlock value from an existing team that is busy but not moving the business.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you hire the wrong version of this role, you will see the same pattern.
      Slow progress, frustration, and a growing sense that data is expensive but unclear.
      This is rarely a people problem.
      It is almost always a clarity problem.
    </p>

    <h3>Signs you are ready to hire a Head of Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>There is a clear business problem to solve</strong>, not just a desire to “do more with data”.</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership agrees on priorities</strong>, even if the delivery path is not yet perfect.</li>
      <li><strong>Data has multiple stakeholders</strong> and you need a single owner for alignment and decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>You have demand coming from the business</strong> that cannot be met with ad hoc reporting.</li>
      <li><strong>There is a budget and runway</strong> to build capability over time, not a quick fix expectation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Signs you should not hire one yet</h3>
    <p>
      This is the part most people skip.
      If any of these are true, the role is likely to become a scapegoat.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No one can define success in 12 months</strong>. If the outcome is vague, delivery will be judged emotionally.</li>
      <li><strong>There is no executive sponsor</strong>. A Head of Data without cover will spend their time negotiating for basics.</li>
      <li><strong>You are hiring the title to solve a political problem</strong>. It will not hold.</li>
      <li><strong>The organisation is not ready to make decisions</strong>. Data work will stall in committees.</li>
      <li><strong>You expect one leader to fix engineering, analytics, governance, and AI</strong> without a plan or team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The three common versions of Head of Data</h3>
    <p>
      Most briefs accidentally combine three roles.
      Clarifying which version you need is the quickest way to improve hiring outcomes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1) The foundation builder</strong><br>
        Focus: data platform basics, data quality, governance, and first delivery wins.<br>
        Best when: you are early stage or rebuilding after years of drift.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2) The operating model leader</strong><br>
        Focus: aligning stakeholders, defining product and delivery shape, prioritisation, and measurable value.<br>
        Best when: you have talent in place but outcomes are inconsistent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3) The scale and optimisation leader</strong><br>
        Focus: reliability, performance, cost control, and scaling a mature data estate.<br>
        Best when: you already have a platform and need industrial strength operations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A good hire can flex across areas.
      A bad brief forces them to do everything, at once, with limited authority.
    </p>

    <h3>What to clarify before you write the job spec</h3>
    <p>
      If you do nothing else, answer these questions internally.
      They remove ambiguity, speed up hiring, and make strong candidates lean in.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Who owns data at board level</strong>, and what decisions can the Head of Data make without escalation.</li>
      <li><strong>Where the role sits</strong>, and what “good collaboration” looks like with technology, product, and commercial teams.</li>
      <li><strong>The first 90 days</strong>, including what must be delivered and what is explicitly out of scope.</li>
      <li><strong>Your governance stance</strong>, including privacy, security, access, and what is non negotiable.</li>
      <li><strong>Your measurement approach</strong>, so you track outcomes, not activity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What good looks like in 12 months</h3>
    <p>
      A strong Head of Data hire usually creates visible progress in four areas.
      Not all at once, but with a clear sequence.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: a shared definition of priorities, ownership, and decision routes.</li>
      <li><strong>Foundations</strong>: the basics are stabilised, and people trust the data more than they did.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery</strong>: a predictable cadence of work that ties to business outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Momentum</strong>: a hiring and capability plan that matches reality, not ambition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A simple hiring approach that works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: pressure test mandate, reporting line, and success metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: decide which version of the role you need most.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: write a spec that reflects your reality and your constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: interview for decision making, stakeholder influence, and delivery pattern.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: be honest about what support exists today, and what will be built.</li>
    </ul>
