<h2>Hiring a Head of Data</h2>

<p><strong>The success of your data strategy depends on clarity of ownership.</strong></p>

<p>
A Head of Data role is often created when an organisation recognises that data has become critical to performance, risk, or growth. The challenge is that many companies hire the title before defining the mandate.
</p>

<h3>Common hiring mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unclear reporting lines between technology and commercial leadership</li>
<li>No defined governance framework</li>
<li>Expecting one leader to fix engineering, analytics and AI simultaneously</li>
<li>Hiring transformation rhetoric instead of operational delivery</li>
</ul>

<h3>What strong Heads of Data expect</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clear executive sponsorship</li>
<li>Defined scope and authority</li>
<li>Realistic resource allocation</li>
<li>Measurable outcomes within 12 months</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we approach the search</h3>
<p>
Before going to market, we pressure test role purpose, reporting structure and capability sequence. Once aligned, we run a retained and targeted search through Scot Lewis Associates, presenting shortlists grounded in evidence, not volume.
