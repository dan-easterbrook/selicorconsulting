  <h2>About Selicor Consulting</h2>

  <p>I help organisations build high-performing data, analytics and AI teams — without the noise, the vague job specs or the six-month hiring drift.</p>

  <p>With more than 18 years recruiting across data, analytics, data science, engineering and AI, I run <strong>Selicor Consulting</strong> in partnership with <strong>Scot Lewis Associates</strong> — a UK-based search firm trusted by leaders who want straight answers, thoughtful shortlists and hires that actually stick.</p>

  <p>My approach is practical and outcomes-first: define the problem, shape the role around the outcomes, then map the market. I work closely with CDOs, Heads of Data, CTOs and CEOs across financial services, insurance, and a range of scale-ups and SMEs where speed and fit matter. I also partner with sports organisations on analytics and performance roles, bringing the same rigour without the hype.</p>

  <p>What clients value is the mix of market depth and candour. I’ll tell you when a spec won’t land, when salary bands are off, and when an “AI” brief is really a data foundation brief in disguise. I keep things anonymous when needed, protect your brand in the market, and prioritise long-term fit over short-term activity.</p>

  <h3>How I Work</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consultative search, not keyword bingo</strong> – role shaping, market mapping, and targeted outreach to the right people, not everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarity before candidates</strong> – success metrics, must-haves vs nice-to-haves, and what “great in 12 months” looks like.</li>
    <li><strong>Shortlists you can defend</strong> – evidence-based profiles, context from real conversations, and honest trade-offs.</li>
    <li><strong>Trusted and discreet</strong> – I represent both you and the candidate with care; anonymous adverts available where appropriate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Data leadership (CDO, Head of Data, Data Platform, Governance)</li>
    <li>Analytics & data science (commercial, product, risk, customer)</li>
    <li>Data engineering & platforms (cloud, MLOps, BI, warehousing)</li>
    <li>AI & automation roles where ROI beats hype</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you want a partner who understands the data market, will challenge assumptions, and will land the person you actually need — let’s talk.</p>
