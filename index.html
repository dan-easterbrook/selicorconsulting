    <h2>About Selicor Consulting</h2>

    <p>I help organisations build high-performing data, analytics and AI teams without the noise, the vague job specs or the six-month hiring drift.</p>

    <p>With more than 18 years recruiting across data, analytics, data science, engineering and AI, I run <strong>Selicor Consulting</strong> in partnership with <strong>Scot Lewis Associates</strong> — a UK-based search firm trusted by leaders who want straight answers, thoughtful shortlists and hires that actually stick.</p>

    <p>My approach is practical and outcomes-first: define the problem, shape the role around the outcomes, then map the market. I work closely with CDOs, Heads of Data, CTOs and CEOs across financial services, insurance, and a range of scale-ups and SMEs where speed and fit matter. I also partner with sports organisations on analytics and performance roles, bringing the same rigour without the hype.</p>

    <p>What clients value is the mix of market depth and candour. I’ll tell you when a spec won’t land, when salary bands are off, and when an “AI” brief is really a data foundation brief in disguise. I keep things anonymous when needed, protect your brand in the market, and prioritise long-term fit over short-term activity.</p>

    <h3>How I Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consultative search, not keyword bingo</strong> – role shaping, market mapping, and targeted outreach to the right people, not everyone.</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity before candidates</strong> – success metrics, must-haves vs nice-to-haves, and what “great in 12 months” looks like.</li>
      <li><strong>Shortlists you can defend</strong> – evidence-based profiles, context from real conversations, and honest trade-offs.</li>
      <li><strong>Trusted and discreet</strong> – I represent both you and the candidate with care; anonymous adverts available where appropriate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Data leadership (CDO, Head of Data, Data Platform, Governance)</li>
      <li>Analytics &amp; data science (commercial, product, risk, customer)</li>
      <li>Data engineering &amp; platforms (cloud, MLOps, BI, warehousing)</li>
      <li>AI &amp; automation roles where ROI beats hype</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you want a partner who understands the data market, will challenge assumptions, and will land the person you actually need — let’s talk.</p>

  <section id="clarity" class="card">
    <h2>Why clarity before recruitment matters</h2>

    <p>Many organisations hire into AI and data because they feel they should. The title sounds right and the brief looks impressive, but underneath it is often unclear.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ownership is unclear</li>
      <li>Reporting lines are political</li>
      <li>Data foundations are weak</li>
      <li>Success criteria are vague</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before we go to market, we pressure test the structure:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What problem the role is truly solving</li>
      <li>Whether it is strategic, operational or both</li>
      <li>What authority the hire will actually hold</li>
      <li>What good looks like in 12 months</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is light touch. One focused conversation, a clear written summary, and a sharper hiring plan. Then we execute the search with confidence.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="approach" class="card">
    <h2>Our approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Capability validation</strong> – a structured conversation to define role purpose, ownership, success metrics and hiring sequence.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Retained and exclusive search</strong> – focused search aligned to validated structure, not a vague job title.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Market and talent mapping</strong> – clear visibility of available capability, compensation realities and where the trade-offs sit.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Long term hiring strategy</strong> – ongoing support as AI capability evolves, so hiring stays aligned to outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
